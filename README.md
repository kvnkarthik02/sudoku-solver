# sudoku-solver using Python - backtracking 

This is a quick and easy suduko puzzle solver made to run in the terminal. This means that, this particular project has no GUI or user friendly feature. I have implemented this using recursion and the backtracking algorithm. In this simple version, we will have to hard code the puzzle layout each time to get the appropriate solved output.
