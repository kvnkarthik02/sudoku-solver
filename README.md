# sudoku-solver using Python - backtracking 

This is a quick and easy suduko puzzle solver made using OpenCV and Backtracking algorithm. 

The frontend part has been done using Streamlit. The code fully works, but for some reason I get an error where Tensorflow does not recognise my GPU (gave up after agessss of trying to fix it :/. Will update once I get a fix to this problem. But the code works, so that's all that matters) . 

To the run the program:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
